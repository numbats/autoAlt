Description: Alt text is important for accessibility of data visualisatons in reports, web sites, academic articles. It can be laborious to write. Here the alt text is written with the help of AI. The user provides a qmd or Rmd file, and it will be auto-processed to extract the ggplot2 code and data plots which will be passed to AI to write the alt text.
