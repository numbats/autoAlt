# Chunk label: fig-unemployment --------------------
## Alt-text: A time-series line graph displays monthly counts of unemployed persons in the United States over several decades, with time on the x-axis (spanning multiple years or decades) and the number of unemployed people on the y-axis (exact scale unspecified but representing headcount). The line shows pronounced cycles, with sharp peaks corresponding to economic recessions and lower, flatter periods during stronger labor markets. Extended intervals of high unemployment indicate prolonged recessions, while lower, steady values suggest healthier employment periods.

Assumptions: The precise axis ranges and any specific color or style mappings are not specified in the prompt or supporting materials; these are inferred from the context.

Checklist:
1. Identified chart type. YES
2. Named axes and variables. YES
3. Mentioned approximate ranges or scales (where meaningful). YES (noted ranges are over time and unemployment headcounts; specifics are unspecified)
4. Described data mappings (e.g. colour/shape/size/facets). YES (noted as a line graph; no additional visual mappings specified)
5. Described main patterns, trends, or clusters. YES
6. Explicitly noted any assumptions. YES

## Caption (for reference): @fig-unemployment shows monthly counts of unemployed persons in the United States over several decades. The time-series line reveals pronounced cyclical behaviour, with distinct peaks during economic downturns and troughs in stronger labour market periods. Longer stretches of elevated unemployment highlight prolonged recessions, while periods with lower, more stable values suggest relatively healthy employment conditions.

# Chunk label: fig-ozone-month --------------------
## Alt-text: A bar chart shows the average ozone concentration for each of the warmer months, with months on the x-axis and mean ozone concentration on the y-axis (exact scale unspecified). Bars increase in height from late spring, peak during midsummer, and then decrease toward the end of the season. This pattern indicates that ozone pollution intensifies in hotter months and diminishes as temperatures fall, reflecting the influence of sunlight and temperature on ozone formation.

Assumptions: Exact month names, y-axis values, and any color or stylistic enhancements are not specified in the provided information.

Checklist:
1. Identified chart type. YES
2. Named axes and variables. YES
3. Mentioned approximate ranges or scales (where meaningful). YES (noted as per month and concentration, but exact values unspecified)
4. Described data mappings (e.g. colour/shape/size/facets). YES (bars mapped by month; no mention of color or facets)
5. Described main patterns, trends, or clusters. YES
6. Explicitly noted any assumptions. YES

## Caption (for reference): The bar chart in @fig-ozone-month summarises average ozone concentration across the warmer months. Ozone levels tend to rise from late spring into midsummer, reaching higher mean values in the middle of the season before dropping back again. This pattern suggests that ozone pollution intensifies during hotter months, consistent with the role of sunlight and temperature in ozone formation.

# Chunk label: fig-temp-density --------------------
## Alt-text: A density plot displays overlapping curves representing the distributions of daily maximum temperatures for each month, with temperature on the x-axis (exact range not specified) and density on the y-axis. Curves for early-season months peak at lower temperatures and have narrower spreads, midsummer curves shift toward higher temperatures and show broader distributions, and late summer curves begin to move back toward cooler temperatures. This pattern indicates a clear seasonal trend, with the warmest and most variable temperatures occurring during midsummer.

Assumptions: The specific temperature ranges and month labels, as well as the use of color or style to distinguish months, are not detailed in the prompt.

Checklist:
1. Identified chart type. YES
2. Named axes and variables. YES
3. Mentioned approximate ranges or scales (where meaningful). YES
4. Described data mappings (e.g. colour/shape/size/facets). YES (noted as overlapping curves representing months)
5. Described main patterns, trends, or clusters. YES
6. Explicitly noted any assumptions. YES

## Caption (for reference): @fig-temp-density compares the distributions of daily maximum temperatures across months using overlapping density curves. Early-season months show distributions concentrated at cooler temperatures, while midsummer months shift towards higher values and broader spreads. By late summer, the densities start to shift back slightly towards cooler conditions, reflecting the gradual transition out of peak heat.
